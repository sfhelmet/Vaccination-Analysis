# Vaccination Analysis
This research paper aims to use the open-source data around us, analyse it
and turn the data into useful information. Information like the number of
daily vaccinations can be used estimate the number of people going in the
following days using Poisson distribution. In a perfect world, that would have
been enough and the number of people showing up everyday would equal the
known average. Unfortunately, we will need to include a margin of safety
also called the confidence interval. Furthermore, a method of approximation
will be used for efficiency in computations.
The second part of the paper will introduce python-plotted graphs, in
order to find patterns or correlation between data(All data manipulation and
processing will be done by and on python). We are looking for grouped points
hinting at a relationships between our variables, Covid test per thousands
people and GDP per capita in USD. This relationship can than be represented
by a line and we can use that same line to estimate or predict the amount of
covid test taken given a country GDP. In addition to finding the best fit line,
concepts concerning curve spread will be used, such as, Variance, Covariance
and Mean.
